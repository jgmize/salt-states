Welcome to ConsumerAffairs salt states documentation!
=======================================================

ConsumerAffairs uses SaltStack_ to manage our infrastructure. We've
open sourced our states_, and our private data is stored in a separate
pillar_ repository. If you aren't familiar with Salt, the walkthrough_ is
highly recommended.
